# Building Bots

This hub walks you through authoring bots with `signal-client`:

1. [Quickstart](quickstart.md) — install, wire an echo bot, and run tests.
2. [Architecture](architecture.md) — understand the surfaces and dependency graph.
3. [Configuration](configuration.md) — load secrets and overrides safely.
4. [Testing](testing.md) — unit, integration, and performance expectations.
5. [Observability](observability.md) & [Diagnostics](diagnostics.md) — keep bots healthy.
6. [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md) — recover from common issues.

Use the guides for task-focused recipes and contribute your own via `docs/bots/guides/`.
