# Change: Audit for Public Release Readiness

## Why
To evaluate the `signal-client` codebase for architectural viability, production readiness, and developer experience before a public, open-source release. This proactive audit will ensure a higher quality v1.0 and build trust with potential users and contributors.

## What Changes
- A structured audit of the codebase will be performed.
- The deliverable will be a detailed report (`AUDIT_REPORT.md`) outlining findings and a prioritized list of recommended improvements.
- No production code or functional specs will be altered by this change. This is a process-only change.

## Impact
- **Affected Specs**: None.
- **Affected Code**: None. The change only involves analysis and reporting.
- **Outcome**: The resulting report will inform future change proposals for architecture, documentation, and feature improvements.
